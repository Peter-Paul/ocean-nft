## Here is a brief overview of the contract's functionalities:

1. Token Minting and Ownership:

The contract allows users to mint ERC-721 tokens named "NeptuneGarden" with the symbol "NG".
The tokens are minted using the safeMint function, which requires users to pay a price (MINT_PRICE) in ether to mint a token. However, the owner can mint up to a certain number of tokens for free (FREE_NFT).
There are limits on the number of tokens that can be minted per wallet (WALLET_LIMIT) and through the auction (AUCTION_LIMIT).

2. Staking Mechanism:

Users can stake their tokens using the `stake` function. Staking a token associates it with a Token Bound Account (TBA) using the `showTBA` function from the `IERC6551Registry` contract.
Tokens that are staked cannot be transferred or burned while staked, and there is a limit on the number of tokens a user can stake (WALLET_LIMIT).

3 .Unstaking Tokens:

Users can unstake their staked tokens using the `unstake` function. This process allows them to retrieve any accumulated rewards (pearls) that they have earned while the token was staked.

4. Pearl Rewards:

The contract calculates "pearl" rewards for stakers based on the time the token has been staked. Pearls are rewarded per minute, with a rate defined by the pearlsPerMinute variable.
Users can view their available rewards using the availableRewards function.

5. Auction:

The contract has an auction system that can be activated and deactivated by the contract owner using the `activateAuction` and `deactivateAuction` functions.
While the auction is active, users can only mint a limited number of tokens through the auction (AUCTION_LIMIT).

6. Pausing Functionality:

The contract can be paused and unpaused by the owner using the `pause` and `unpause` functions, respectively.

7. Ownership and Withdrawal:

The contract owner can withdraw any ether balance in the contract using the `withdraw` function.
The contract owner can set the mint price using the `setMintPrice` function.
